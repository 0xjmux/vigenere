# vigenere
A program to encrypt and decrypt vigenere ciphers

This is a small Python 3 program I wrote that can encrypt and decrypt vigenere ciphers. 
You have a few command options in the terminal when you run the program. 
```
encrypt [ciphertext] - encrypt a block of text, which you enter after inputting the ciphertext
decrypt [ciphertext] - decrypt a block of text, which you enter after inputting the ciphertext
help  - output a help menu, which looks just like this
```

When you type `encrypt` or `decrypt`, you need to type the key immediately after it. After you hit enter, the program will ask you for the message/ciphertext you want to encrypt/decrypt. An example command would look like <br>
```
encrypt key
Please enter your message
hello
```
and should output `rijvs`.
